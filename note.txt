some tip:

changing from resnet50 to se-resnext50 backbone improve the gray image score from 0.419 to 0.430.

note:

if you want to get high LB score, you most improve the mask non-max suppression provided. Together with other improvement like class balancing, adjusting network structure, etc you can above 0.450 just with the gray images alone.


for color images, you need to treat it as a separate class.

if you treat all images as single class, then the common thing for all of them is only outline, which is very weak feature.

if you treat them as separate classes, you will have more common things within a class (e.g. the interior is also the same within the class)

I train two separate mask-rcnn, one on gray images and another on purple images (converted to gray scale). both perform reasonably well.


All trained model and results are on gray images only. By submitting 53 gray images, you get LB score of 0.419 (i.e. 0.5139 = 0.419/65*53 per image on average)


for the current code, automatic rate schedule is disabled (see " LR = None ").

i use manual schedule instead. i.e set rate =0.01 and then run and monitor the loss. when the loss does not improve, i restart the training with rate=0.001, loading the previous weights as initialization.

i need to check all 4 loss of mask rcnn are balanced and compare each of the 4 loss for train and validation set. So it is easier to use manual schedule.


currently, just use the mask from the higher score detection box. it will be placed on "top" and overwrite any previous pixel label.

1. use merage   https://www.kaggle.com/bonlime/train-test-image-mosaic
2. balance traing 
3. small box
4. mask loss pay more attention and also post processing
